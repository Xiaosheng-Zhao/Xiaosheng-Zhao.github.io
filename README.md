The repository for Can Diffusion Model Conditionally Generate Astrophysical Images? (Zhao et al. 2023). This script is mainly built upon:[Conditional Diffusion MNIST](https://github.com/TeaPearce/Conditional_Diffusion_MNIST), [guided-diffusion](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion) and [improved-diffusion](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion).

The requirements for installation is rather simple, please check the `requirements.txt`. In this repository, you can know all about the basics of the paper [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239). 

You can directly run the `main.py` which will give some outputs to `outputs`.

The StyleGAN2 implementation is based on the related branch in [this repository](https://github.com/dkn16/stylegan2-pytorch).
